Q: In which Case shoud you use callback in React setState?
A: If you want to perform an action just after changing the state, you would like to use the call back, because setState works asynchronously,
this.state variable is not immediately changed. In such cases, the callback in setState could be used. For example I have used the callback
in the repository fetchRicePuppyRecepie.

Q: What are POJOs and JAVA Beans?
A: 
POJO: These are plain old java objects. It has no restrictions like requiring constructors, requiring annotations,
using any specific access-modifiers. They are easy to read and understand and increases the reusability of a program. 
POJO is an object which encapsulates Business Logic. Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pojo-vs-java-beans/

JAVA Beans: Beans are special type of POJOs. They have some restrictions like:
  -Fields should be private. This is to provide the complete control on fields.
  -Fields should have getters or setters or both.
  -A no-arg constructor should be there in a bean.
  -Fields are accessed only by constructor or getter setters.
  -They should implement Serializable interface.
All JavaBeans are POJOs but not all POJOs are JavaBeans.
